    <strong>No really, I'm serious.</strong> Ask any one of my friends where you should go for coffee in Tuscaloosa,
    and they'll probably say my place. You want a cup of dark, strong coffee? Done. Give me 2.5 minutes
    (the general guideline for how long you should immerse the coffee in a french press) and you'll have a piping
    hot cup of joe. Feeling something lighter? Think coffee needs sugar? Let me show you what a Chemex can do with
    a good Ethiopian single origin (personal favorite is Yirgacheffe). Or maybe you want something sweet and creamy.
    No worries. My latte art may be nonexistent but I promise I'm working on it.
