<h4 class="project-title">About The Site</h4>

<div class="about-me">
    This website was made with jeykll, a ruby gem that is used to build static websites from dynamic components.
    It was made as an exercise in web development and served to familiarize myself with html, CSS (Or rather sass) and
    javascript. Font used is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?selection.family=Raleway:200,500,700&query=raleway">
    Raleway</a>, and icons used were pulled from <a href="https://icomoon.io/">icomoon</a>.
