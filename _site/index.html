    <h3>About Me</h3>

    <div class="about-me">
        <p> <strong>Hey, I'm Andrew.</strong> I've spent the last 3 years all over the place, so I'll give you a run
            through. </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Jacksonville, FL: Home sweet home. Graduated from Stanton College Preparatory in 2014 with an
                    IB Diploma thankfully.
                </li>


                <li>Tuscaloosa, AL: Currently a 19 (or 20) year old undergraduate at the University of Alabama
                majoring in Computer Science and French. Alabama told me they would cover my tuition, so I said yes
                to free education and no to student debt. I've been learning programming and software design while
                keeping myself sane by taking coursework in French. I have about 2 more semesters till I finish the
                French part of my degree, and 2 years until I graduate. Learned C as my first programming language,
                then moved to C++, Java, SQL, javascript, and Ruby.
                </li>


                <li>Tours, France: I spent a summer at L'institut Touraine, a school for foreigners to learn
                    french, in 2015. Had a brief stint in Belgium but that was more for pleasure than education.
                    Fueled my love of France and brought my total number of years studying the language to 6.
                </li>


                <li>Atlanta, GA: Currently employed by Polytron, inc, as a co-op where I design networking solutions
                    for manufacturers. Here I learned about the wonders of PLC Ladder Logic and became very proficient
                    in using MSSMS/Database Management.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <p>
            TL:DR; I'm passionate about languages, spoken or typed, and my education path has been in their pursuit.
        </p>
        <p> Ignore the whitespace below, I am struggling to learn css </p>
