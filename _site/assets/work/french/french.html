<h4 class="project-title">French</h4>
<div class="about-me">
    <p><strong>I've been learning french for the past 6 years now,</strong> and consider myself to be able to
        operate with a professional working proficiency. Reading and writing are my strong suits, with oral and
        speaking following closely behind. My love for the language started in High School after being drawn in to
        the country's rich cinema history and has flourished with my classes in classical french literature,
        philosophy, and phonetics these past two years.</p>
    <p style="padding-top: 10px"><strong>Having the opportunity to live and learn in france</strong> was a
        tremendous experience and served as a huge boost in confidence in my abilities. I hope to return to France,
        ideally for work but also potentially to study for (and hopefully receive) my DALF C1 certification.
