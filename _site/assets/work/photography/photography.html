<div class="about-me">
    <p><strong>I'm currently rocking a K-5</strong> with the kit 18-55mm and a 50mm prime that is legacy glass,
        100% manual all the way from the focus to the aperture. My alternate is an old minolta film camera, which I
        love to use but only on occasion as film and development costs are high. I've been taking pictures for the last
        2 or 3 years, and incorporated it into an elective course this past year. It has served as an excellent way to
        both document my travels and provide a creative outlet during the semester.

        <strong>I've volunteered this skill</strong> with Beat Auburn Beat Hunger, a student-led volunteer organization
        on campus and taken a senior portraits during graduation season. However, most of my photography is for
        personal enjoyment and sharing on <a href="https://instagram.com/thereforeauare">instagram</a> and
        <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/hastere/">flickr</a>.
