    <p><strong>My languages</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>C</strong> - My first language. I actually came into the college thinking that I was going
                to major in mathematics. One of the requirements was programming, and after my first semester,
                I was hooked. I switched over to computer science, and began this wonderful journey.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>C++</strong> - The big brother. This was what I learned sorting algorithms on and wrote
                projects implementing them.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Java</strong> - Used with intoduction to software engineering, where our team had to develop
                a large scale piece of software to manage "Chocaholics Anonymous", a sort of health insurance company
                for chocolate addicts, as our term project.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Ruby</strong> - What I've used for web development, specifically Rails with server integration.
                It is what this site has been built on.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Javascript</strong> - Multiple forms, but mostly jQuery.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>TSQL</strong> - Used when writing stored procedures to automate data collection and relation with
                Microsoft SQL server.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>PLC Ladder Logic</strong> - Experience mainly with Allen-Bradley PLCs and their associated
                software, such as RSLogix 5000, RSLinx, etc.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <p> I would include the Microsoft Office Suite (including Visio) but they aren't really programming languages.</p>
